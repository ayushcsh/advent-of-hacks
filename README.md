# Advent of Hacks
Every year in December, several platforms organize CTF-style hacking events. These challenges are free and offer a great opportunity to learn, practice ethical hacking, and even win prizes (from merch and swag to real gadgets and gear).

Below is a curated list of the main free cybersecurity holiday events for this season:
